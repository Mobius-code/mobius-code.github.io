# Setting Up Your Environment
Here we will install Go and a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

If you are brand new to programming, a full-fledged IDE might be a bit overwhelming at first, as they are usually packed with tons of features meant for professional software developers.

If you are comfortable using a text editor like vim or nano, that should serve you quite well to get you started. It's important not to overwhelm yourself at the outset.

After you become comfortable writing simple programs in Go and compiling and running your code, then perhaps look into switching to an IDE.

You can run Go in the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/) online if you do not wish to install it to your computer.

## Installing Go

Linux
BSD
Mac
Windows
Haiku

This tutorial uses **Go 1.21.5**

### Linux
Go is available as a package in all of the major Linux distributions for nearly every architecture your distribution supports. Search for either `go` or `golang` with your package manager.

For example, to install Go for Debian:
```bash
apt install golang
```

If you are using a stable distribution, you might consider installing the latest stable version of Go. Similarly, if Go is not available as a package in your distribution's repository, you will need to download and install a pre-built binary. In order to do so, see the official Go [Downloads](https://go.dev/dl/) page and follow the installation guide.

To actually write our code, we will need either a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment.

Text editors:
* vi/vim/neovim
* nano
* emacs

IDEs:

* VScodium
* Lapce
