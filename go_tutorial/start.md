Welcome to this programming tutorial using Go, and welcome to the Go community!

Go is a blazingly fast programming language that is fairly easy to learn. It is also a very popular programming language that enjoys first-class support from Google.

This tutorial is meant for beginners who want to learn how to code. However, it could also serve as an introduction to Go for more experienced programmers.

The goal of this tutorial is to give you a solid foundation in programming from scratch, not for you to simply type things to your screen like a robot! However, it is important that you practice, practice, practice! That is the only way to really learn how to program.

With all that out of the way, let's begin!

If you are new to programming, start with the first lesson and proceed through each topic in order. Every proceeding lesson builds upon everything you learned previously.

We will finish the tutorial by building a few real-world programs.

Topics:
1. [Intro to Programming With Go](intro.md)
2. [Setting Up Your Environment](install.md)
3. [Writing Your First Program](first_program.md)
4. Program Structure and Syntax
5. Debugging Your Code
6. [Keywords](keywords.md)
7. [Data Types](data_types.md)
8. [Variables](variables.md)
9. Operators & Order of Operations
10. Control Flow
11. Introduction to Functions
12. Functions Continued
13. Arrays
14. Slices
15. Maps
16. Pointers
17. Interfaces
18. Concurrency
19. Packages
20. Building Software

Don't be intimidated by these topics. We will take a crawl, walk, run approach so that you will be more than comfortable transitioning from one topic to the next. Again, the goal is to turn you into a programmer, not someone who can follow a tutorial and simply type what you see on the screen. By the time you finish one lesson, you will have the confidence and skills to tackle the next one.

### The Reason I Decided to Write This Tutorial
I have been using the Linux and BSD operating systems for many years, and this tutorial is one of my ways of paying it forward and giving back to a community who has given so much to me.

Furthermore, I was very dissatisfied with the resources available to teach someone how to program using Go. There are many tutorials that teach the syntax of the language, but none that I could find that teach an absolute beginner how to actually program using Go.

This is also a way for myself to become a better programmer. I struggled for a while to actually learn how to program, and if you're reading this, it's likely you've experienced the same frustration. This tutorial teaches programming from this perspective, incorporating all the aspects of programming that helped me to grasp certain concepts better.

In this respect, this tutorial makes use of what's called pseudo-code, which is halfway between our natural language and a programming language. It's important that we don't get bogged down in the syntax of Go so much as learn the fundamental concepts of programming.
